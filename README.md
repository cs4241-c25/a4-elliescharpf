I changed a lot from Assignment 3 to 4. I still have it saving to MongoDB but I changed the style and some of the functional code like the edit and delete transaction buttons, I got rid of the clear transaction button. I had a really hard time with this assignment because I havent used React before so my app is very basic. I made a video as well as deployed my app because I dont think the deployment works correctly.
