I changed a lot from Assignment 3 to 4. I still have it saving to MongoDB but I changed the style and some of the functional code like the edit and delete transaction buttons, I got rid of the clear transaction button. I had a really hard time with this assignment because I havent used React before so my app is very basic. I made a video as well as deployed my app because I dont think the deployment works correctly. In the video I show that you can't log in unless you are registeres, and then I register the new user and log in. Then I add a transaction and edit the amount and category and then it updates, and I also delete that transaction. Then I add another transaction to show how MongoDB Stores the data that I just entered into the transaction table.
